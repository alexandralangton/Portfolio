# Alexandra Langton's Portfolio

### Hello and welcome!

This site is very much still under construction and not at all finished. However, if you'd like a sneak preview, here's a guide to get you started:

```js
git clone https://github.com/alexandralangton/Portfolio.git
cd Portfolio
npm install
npm run start-dev
```

A local version of this site will then be accessible at http://localhost:8000/

If you have any feedback I'd love to hear from you! Thanks for checking out this repo.
